          The short version of my story is this: I’m a career-switcher, having
          started my career in the languages industry before landing my current
          role as a Pega Apprentice. I loved learning languages (and still do!)
          because I’m a big fan of grammar rules (the first clue that maybe I’d
          enjoy coding), but I struggled to find a job in the languages industry
          that was the right fit for me.<br></br>
          <br></br> After discovering that I enjoyed coding, I taught myself
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Codecademy and worked hard at
          networking. I went to in-person events, arranged shadowing in a tech
          team, joined an online programme for women in tech and worked with a
          mentor to improve my CV and prepare for interviews.<br></br>
          <br></br> I applied for mainly apprenticeships and grad schemes, as
          well as a few junior roles. I had mixed results but eventually, in
          January 2024, I accepted an offer as a Pega Apprentice. I started the
          role in February along with seven others and we embarked upon the
          journey of learning the low-code system of Pega!<br></br>
          <br></br> Outside of work, I still think of myself as a linguist. As
          well as keeping up with German, Spanish and Italian through
          Netflix/books/chatting to friends, I’ve started learning Norwegian on
          Duolingo ahead of my friend’s wedding there in August!<br></br>
          <br></br> I’m also a keen salsa and bachata dancer and spend many a
          weekend travelling to different cities to go to dance classes.
          <br></br>
          <br></br> Last but not least I’m a volunteer with Girlguiding, working
          towards their mission “helping all girls know they can do anything”.

        <h2>My story</h2>
        <p>
          If someone had told me when I graduated with a degree in German and
          Spanish Linguistic Studies that I would end up working in tech, I
          never would have believed them. Yet here I am! Working as a developer
          with a humanities background might not seem like the obvious choice,
          but I am here to tell you that it’s actually a lot more logical than
          you might think! Here’s my story…
        </p>
        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>
          I was lucky enough to attend a specialist language college, so had the
          opportunity to learn German, French and Spanish at high school. I
          didn’t get on with French, but I loved German and Spanish. German
          always came more naturally to me, whereas most of my classmates
          preferred Spanish. The reason I liked German was the logic and the
          grammar rules – perhaps because I approached it like a maths problem
          to be solved? <br></br>
          <br></br>I ended up studying German and Spanish at A-level, along with
          English language and Maths. I loved that maths was a break from the
          essay writing, and I just loved maths in general. It often took a
          while for the concepts to click (I was that annoying person in class
          asking too many questions), but once they did, I was fine. I always
          said I would have loved to have studied further maths, too, but there
          wasn’t enough room in my timetable. <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>University</h3>
        <p>
          My original plan was to study a German and Spanish degree. I had
          narrowed down which universities I was interested in and had already
          visited a few when I went to a taster linguistics lecture at an open
          day. I can’t remember what the topic was, I just knew that I was
          fascinated, and based on that one 45-minute lecture I decided to add
          linguistics to my degree. Looking back, that seems a very risky move,
          but it paid off! <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Not many universities allowed you to study linguistics alongside two
          foreign languages, so I ended up at Southampton. My linguistics
          modules included Phonology, Syntax, Sound and Voice, Second Language
          Acquisition and more. They were always my favourite modules and the
          ones I got the best grades in. I liked the language modules too, but
          as somewhat of an introvert, I lacked the confidence to practise
          speaking much – I would much rather do some grammar exercises.{" "}
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>Working life</h3>
        <p>
          I was always adamant I’d work in the languages industry. The saying
          “if you don’t use it, you lose it” was always in the back of my head,
          and I didn’t want years of hard work to disappear. <br></br>
          <br></br>
          But which job to pick? <br></br>
          <br></br>I didn’t fancy teaching; I had experience as a teaching
          assistant and many years as a Brownie leader, so would probably enjoy
          it, but I knew the workload was heavy. <br></br>
          <br></br>I didn’t like the idea of having to speak a foreign language
          for work as I wasn’t convinced my skills were quite good enough.{" "}
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          But I always enjoyed translation: there was no sense of urgency as it
          was dealing with the written word, and I wouldn’t have to produce
          perfect German/Spanish – I just had to understand it, and then be able
          to render it in English. So my first job out of uni was as a
          Translation Project Manager at a small, local translation agency.{" "}
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          As a Project Manager, I wasn’t doing any actual translation myself,
          but I proofread texts and dealt with clients and suppliers, which gave
          me a great insight into the industry. I also started evening classes
          in Italian, which I loved. <br></br>
          <br></br>
          After a few years I was starting to wonder whether it was time to move
          on. I hadn’t fully made my mind up yet, but in the end it was Brexit
          which gave me the final push. <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>Germany</h3>
        <p>
          My year abroad during my degree had been to Spain. I’d chosen that
          because Spanish was my weaker language and I wanted to take the
          opportunity to improve it. It was 100% the right decision and I never
          regretted it, but part of me always wished I could have spent some
          time in Germany, too. So I told myself that one day I’d live in
          Germany. <br></br>
          <br></br>
          It was always a vague, “some time in the future” plan, but then Brexit
          loomed closer. I knew that once it was official, it would be much
          harder to live abroad thanks to visas and stricter requirements, so I
          thought I’d better do it sooner rather than later. I applied to be a
          teaching assistant with the British Council (the same thing I did in
          Spain) and set off for 9 months in Bremen in 2020, mid-pandemic.{" "}
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>Translation</h3>
        <p>
          I fulfilled my goal of improving my German, though I didn’t travel as
          much as I’d have liked thanks to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Towards
          the end of my time there, I knew I had to start thinking about my next
          job. I decided the time was right to jump into freelance translation.
          I had industry knowledge thanks to my 3 years working at a translation
          agency, and my parents had said I could stay with them until I got
          established, meaning I wouldn’t have to worry about paying rent if my
          income was fluctuating a lot, or just very low, in the first few
          months. It was a scary decision to make but I knew I wanted to give it
          a try. I officially set up my business in June 2021 and embraced the
          ups and downs of being self-employed. <br></br>
          <br></br>
          However, after about two years, I’d stopped enjoying it. The projects
          I was being offered weren’t interesting, and too many clients were
          requesting Machine Translation Post-Editing (MTPE) instead of
          translation, which takes all the joy and creativity out of it. My
          earnings were also low, and while I could have coped with that if I at
          least enjoyed the work, it didn’t seem a worthwhile path to follow any
          more. <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>Deciding my next steps</h3>
        <p>
          Back to the drawing board. I always thought I’d stay in the languages
          industry, but I felt I’d exhausted all options that appealed to me. So
          then I started reflecting on why I liked languages so much. It wasn’t
          speaking or writing; my favourite part was the learning process
          itself. I loved grammar rules and syntax and piecing small parts
          together to form something bigger. In other words: problem-solving.
          Around the same time, I was chatting to a friend who also did a
          linguistics degree but was now working in cyber security. I started to
          wonder if coding could be the right choice for me. <br></br>
          <br></br>I found the website Codecademy and took their quiz to help me
          choose which language to try. I had said I had an analytical mind, so
          it pointed me towards python. I did a few beginner lessons just to see
          what I thought, and really enjoyed it. <br></br>
          <br></br>
          However, I hadn’t dedicated much time to it, and I was still unsure if
          I should commit to fully retraining, so I decided to pay for a short
          course to help keep me motivated. I read more about coding and many
          sources recommended HTML and CSS as a great starting point, so I
          signed up for the SheCodes Basics course. In 3 weeks I created a
          webpage with some simple interactions and knew this was the path I
          wanted to follow. <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>Retraining</h3>
        <p>
          Once I was serious about my next steps, I had to decide the best way
          to learn. I looked into bootcamps, but many were really expensive and
          4-5 hours a day. So not only would I have to pay for them, I also
          wouldn’t be able to earn at the same time due to the long hours. Even
          the free ones had a big time commitment, and had a tough application
          process. I much preferred the idea of studying at my own pace and
          being able to fit in my lessons when it suited me, rather than having
          to commit to a set time. I decided to pay for a year’s membership with
          Codecademy, which would give me access to more topics, as well as
          quizzes, practice projects, completion certificates and interview
          prep. <br></br>
          <br></br>I signed up for the Full-Stack Engineering path because I
          liked the idea of learning everything, but after a certain point I
          decided to switch to the Front-End path because it was half as much to
          learn, so I knew I’d be able to start job hunting sooner. I was lucky
          that being self-employed meant I could dedicate as much time as I
          wanted to learning. I accepted enough work to keep an income trickling
          in, but spent as much time as possible on Codecademy and building
          practice projects. I also found myself doing it in the evening and on
          the weekends because I enjoyed it so much. <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>Networking</h3>
        <p>
          Eventually, I reluctantly accepted that I would have to start
          networking and getting my name out there to help me find out job
          opportunities. I was happy to discover that networking isn’t just
          walking into a huge room of people and trying to give everyone a
          business card, and it doesn’t have to be scary, either. <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In May 2023, I spent 3 days shadowing the tech team of a big company
          in Leeds. I was still brand new to coding so a lot of things went over
          my head, but it was a great insight to how coding works in real life.
          In September I was accepted on to the Cajigo 16-week accelerator
          programme, a mentoring scheme for women in tech that paired all
          participants up with their own mentor and hosted weekly online
          webinars with female leaders in the tech space. As I was learning on
          my own, this was a fantastic way to connect with women in tech – many
          of them career switchers like me – and get a weekly dose of
          inspiration and advice. <br></br>
          <br></br>I was also lucky enough to be mentored by a Software Engineer
          working at Microsoft, who met with me weekly over Zoom to help me prep
          for interviews. <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>Applying to jobs</h3>
        <p>
          When I was nearing the end of my course, around November 2023, I
          decided it was time to start applying to jobs. I sought out junior
          roles, but this felt quite ambitious given that I didn’t have a
          computer science degree, or even a formal bootcamp certificate, so I
          also applied to apprenticeships/grad schemes. These generally required
          no prior experience but had lower salaries and a start date of
          September 2024, which wasn’t ideal. But any job was better than none!{" "}
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I made a spreadsheet to keep track of which jobs I’d applied
          to and who I needed to chase up. I had mixed results: one position had
          actually stopped recruiting several months before but hadn’t bothered
          to remove the job advert; some never replied; some invited me to take
          part in online assessment centres. I got through to the live interview
          for one of those, and at the same time was invited to interview with a
          small, fully remote company who I’d submitted my CV to (no long cover
          letter or behavioural questions for them!). <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Within the space of a few days, I received offers for both – but it
          was a very easy decision. The grad scheme was at a bank and as such
          I’m sure it would have offered good opportunities for progression. But
          it was a low salary and the training programme was three years.{" "}
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The other job, however, was still an apprentice/entry level role, but
          had a better salary, was much more convenient as it was fully remote,
          started immediately, and best of all I’d got really good vibes from
          the interviews. The four people I spoke with were friendly and open
          and it was so clear they all loved their job, which I thought was a
          great sign. So I accepted! <br></br>
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>My first tech role</h3>
        <p>
          On 12th February 2024 I had my first official day as a woman in tech,
          working as a Pega Apprentice. Although the Pega low-code system is
          different to the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I’d learnt, it has the
          same problem-solving elements that I love about coding. Add to that
          the wonderful, supportive team, and I know I made the right decision
          with my career switch. <br></br>
          <br></br>
